# CodeinGame
a series of solved code in game problems. Code in game doesn't actually have a function as far as im aware that allows you to save your solutions, so i created a repository for me to save my solution.

One large drawback is that the initial problem is hard to implement, so in actuallity, i dont have many of the orginial problems/inputs.
